# Cursor AI Rules

## Documentation Files
- NEVER create Markdown (.md) files unless explicitly requested by the user
- NEVER create README files proactively
- NEVER create documentation files without explicit user request
- Only create .md files when user specifically asks for them

## Code Changes
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Focus on implementing functionality, not documentation
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented
